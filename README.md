R quant analysis code (for FX)


This is a collection of some code that I wrote for a term project while doing 
a Masters of Finance degree at London Business School. Its pretty simple, just 
producing some descriptive graphs and doing basic analysis. Some of the code may
be incomplete, and I cant supply the data used, but some of the R techniques may
be useful.
